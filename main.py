# TODO:
#   1. this program will run as a background process, and whenever a cursor is created, a new thread of it will be
#      created and a small window above cursor OR status bar at the bottom of cursor's window will be created with
#      suggestions.
#   2. the program has to only access current + last sentence defined by a dot and a space ('. '). possibly more in the
#      future, depending on how smart suggestions are.
#   3. save terms which would otherwise be considered typos/incorrect. never save full sentences unless told explicitly.
#   3. terms should be rated based on their use.
#   4. possibly have some kind of way to save shortcut terms.
#   5. separate sentences into parts? this will make things easier and make sense but its less modular.
#   6. implement vectors? well see how complicated/hard that is.

#  ...Talking and making TODOs is easy... Time to do stuff. Oh, well.
